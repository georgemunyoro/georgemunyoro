## Hi there, George here ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**georgemunyoro/georgemunyoro** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

 ðŸ˜„ I love code, there's just something about building software that excites me. I love learning, and on most free days, I can usually be found at my computer, leisurely reading documentation or relaxing on the couch with a cup of something nice, and a programming book.

 ðŸŒ± I'm something of an artist in my spare time, and enjoy drawing, photography and architecture. I love beautiful things, and I always try and incorporate this in my work. Not only am I driven to build great software, but to build great software that looks great.

 âš¡ On the frontend, I've worked with Vue and React, my favorite tools for building user interfaces on the web. I've also worked extensively with Bootstrap and Bulma, as well as having a good understanding of CSS and SASS for building beautiful, responsive web applications quickly.

 âš¡ Despite the designer traits, I'm still a backend developer at heart. I mainly work with Python, Django, Flask, JavaScript/Typescript, and Node.js, but am a fast learner and open to learning new technologies, which I do fairly quickly.
 :)
