## Hi there, George here ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**georgemunyoro/georgemunyoro** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

 ðŸ˜„ I love code, there's just something about building software that excites me. I love learning, and on most free days, I can usually be found at my computer hacking away at some code, leisurely reading documentation or relaxing on the couch with a cup of something nice, and my laptop of course.

 ðŸ’¬ If there's a computer, and especially programming involved, I'm almost certainly interested. If you'd like to support me, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/georgemunyoro) :coffee: :)
